## Project Background

ByteX, a global e-commerce company founded in 2018, specializes in selling popular electronics like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad products. I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to extract insights and deliver recommendations to improve performance across sales, product, and marketing teams.

## Executive Summary

ByteX's sales analysis of 108k records across 2019-2022 shows annual revenue stabilizing at around $7 million, nearing pre-COVID levels, with North America and EMEA contributing 80% of sales. Monitors and AirPods account for 60% of revenue, though customer retention is a concern as unique and repeat purchase rates have declined by 15% and 10%, respectively. ByteX can benefit from expanding top product lines, optimizing bundling, and enhancing loyalty programs to increase customer lifetime value. Targeted growth in APAC and LATAM, along with improvements to digital channels like the mobile app, will strengthen ByteX's market position and drive sustainable growth.

### Key Product Performance

- During the pandemic, laptop sales soared, with MacBook orders increasing by 400% and ThinkPad by 220%. This trend has since reversed post-pandemic.
- Four products: monitors, AirPods, laptops, and Samsung Cable Pack, generate 96% of total revenue.
- AirPods account for 45% of all orders ($7.7M revenue).
- Monitors lead in revenue, contributing $9.8 million (35% of total sales) from 2019 to 2022.
- Samsung Cable Pack represents 20% of orders but only 2% of revenue, likely due to its low price or use in promotions.

### Customer Growth and Repeat Purchase Trends

- ByteX's unique customers grew steadily from 2019 to 2021, peaking at nearly 30,000 in 2021, but declined sharply by nearly 40% in 2022.
- Repeat purchase rates (≥2 orders) consistently decreased, from 20.22% in 2019 to 14.76% in 2022, indicating challenges in retaining customers after initial purchases.
- The stability in the number of repeat customers suggests a core base of loyal customers who consistently make multiple purchases each year.
- The decline in both unique and repeat customers in 2022 highlights potential shifts in market dynamics or customer preferences.

### Loyalty Program Performance

- Loyalty members make their first purchase 20 days earlier (30% less time) than non-loyalty members (50 days vs. 70 days).
- Post-pandemic, loyalty metrics surged but began slowing by 2022.
- Loyalty members now lead in key metrics, generating $500K more in revenue, spending $30 more per order, and placing 500K more orders than non-loyalty members.
- The loyalty program performs strongly in North America, while APAC and LATAM regions remain volatile, suggesting a need for targeted strategies.
- Loyalty purchases have a higher refund rate than non-loyalty purchases.

### Sales by Platforms & Channels

- Direct channel account for 83% ($23M) of ByteX's sales.
- Social media contributes 1% of sales, and affiliate channels contribute 3% ($878K).
- Affiliate channels have the highest average order value (AOV) at $303, while email campaigns have the lowest AOV at $181.
- The website generates 97% ($27M) of sales with an AOV of $304, whereas the mobile app ($867K) lags with an AOV of $47.
- Further considerations on channel performance are detailed in the assumptions and caveats section.

### Refund Rate Trends

- Refund rates for high-ticket items peaked early in the pandemic but have since stabilized at 4-6%.
- In 2021, refunds decreased across all products compared to the the previous two years.
- Laptops had the highest refund rates in 2019 and 2020 (17%) but have since dropped to 6-9%, aligning with other product categories.
- Apple Airpods Headphones have the highest refund count at 2.6K (5% refund rate).
- Loyalty purchases exhibit a higher refund rate than non-loyalty purchases, potentially warranting further investigation.

## Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Caveats

### Questions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement

- **Unmatched `customer_id` Records**
    - Which table should be the primary source for `customer_id` to maintain data consistency across analyses?

- **`marketing_channel` and `account_creation_method` in the `customers` table**
    - How is this data recorded, and what does it specifically represent?
    - What factors contribute to their deterministic relationship?
    - Does `marketing_channel` capture the initial account creation touchpoint, or does it represent the origin of each individual purchase (which is more relevant for tracking sales)?

- **`loyalty_program` in the `customers` table**
    - Is `loyalty_program` account-specific or tied to individual orders?
    - Can loyalty membership status vary between orders for the same user, i.e., is it a subscription or a one-time sign-up?

### Assumptions and Caveats

- **Refund Records**: No refunds were recorded for 2022, which is an anomaly warranting further examination.
- **Deterministic Relationship in Data**: Each `marketing_channel` is uniquely linked to one `account_creation_method`, indicating a one-to-one mapping. This lack of variation may require attention from the data engineering team to confirm intended relationships.
    - ![One to One Mapping](Data/visualizations/order_count_channelxmethod.webp)
      
- **Loyalty Program Clarification**:
    - Ambiguity exists in the `loyalty_program` variable—it's unclear if it's tied to the user's account or is specific to individual orders.
    - Can a user be a loyalty member for one purchase and not another? This clarification is essential for accurately measuring program performance.
      
- **Sales and Marketing Channels**: Direct and email channels are top drivers of sales, yet the link between these channels and the loyalty program is uncertain due to deterministic channel-account-order relationships.
    - **Attribution of Purchases to Channels**: Ideally, each purchase would be attributed to the marketing channel that directly led to it, rather than defaulting all future purchases to the initial channel. However, the current dataset reflects the entry point at account creation, not at individual purchase. Despite this, the data provides insights on loyalty membership by channel:
        - **Email Channel**: Highest loyalty membership rate at 58%.
        - **Direct Channel**: Largest loyalty membership count, with 32,906 members (72% of all loyalty members).
    - These metrics could inform strategic channel emphasis to boost loyalty engagement.
 
- **Unmatched Customer Records**: Approximately 27k (25%) of transactions have `customer_id`s not present in the `customers` table. This discrepancy suggests missing data or data entry errors, impacting SQL queries and resulting in NULLs when joining on `customer_id`.
    - This issue arises from the segmented structure of SQL tables (`orders`, `customers`, `geo_lookup`, `order_status`). However, in Excel, where all data resides in a single table, this issue doesn't occur.
